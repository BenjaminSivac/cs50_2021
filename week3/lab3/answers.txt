sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It instantly "processed" the numbers when it was already sorted and therefore was the quickest of the three. 
This also means it was the slowest when the sample was reversed. 

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It was the fastest of the three on sorting large, random sample sizes as its algorithm is better suited for it. 

sort3 uses: Selection sort 

How do you know?: Unlike bubble sort, its running time was about the same for the ordered and reversed samples.
